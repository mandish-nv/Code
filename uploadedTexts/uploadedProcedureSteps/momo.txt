            <li>Prepare the Dough:</li>
            <p>
              In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour and salt.
              Gradually add water while kneading until a smooth, pliable dough
              is formed. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for
              at least 30 minutes.
            </p>

            <li>Make the Filling:</li>
            <p>
              In a large bowl, mix the ground buffalo meat with the chopped
              onions, green onions, cilantro, garlic, and ginger. Add the soy
              sauce, mustard oil (if using), turmeric powder, cumin powder,
              coriander powder, salt, and pepper. Mix well to combine. Add the
              vegetable oil to the mixture and combine thoroughly. This will
              help keep the filling moist.
            </p>

            <li>Prepare the Dipping Sauce:</li>
            <p>
              Roast the tomatoes and dried red chilies on an open flame or in a
              hot pan until charred. Blend the roasted tomatoes, chilies,
              garlic, and sesame seeds into a smooth paste. Heat the oil in a
              pan and cook the paste for a few minutes until thickened. Add salt
              to taste.
            </p>

            <li>Assemble the Momos:</li>
            <p>
              Roll the dough into a long log and cut it into small equal-sized
              pieces. Roll each piece into a thin, round wrapper (about 3 inches
              in diameter). Place a tablespoon of the filling in the center of
              each wrapper. Fold and pleat the edges to seal the dumpling.
              Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.
            </p>

            <li>Steam the Momos:</li>
            <p>
              Lightly grease a steamer basket with oil. Arrange the momos in the
              basket, making sure they don't touch each other. Steam the momos
              for about 10-12 minutes, until the dough is cooked and slightly
              translucent.
            </p>

            <li>Serve:</li>
            <p>Serve the steamed momos hot with the prepared dipping sauce.</p>

                  Ensure the dough is soft but not sticky, and let it rest for
                  at least 30 minutes to make it easier to work with.

                  Mix the filling ingredients well to ensure even distribution
                  of flavors. Chilling the filling slightly helps in handling.

                  Roll the dough into thin, even wrappers to ensure they cook
                  evenly and are not too doughy.
